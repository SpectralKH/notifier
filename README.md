# Notifier

## Getting Started

All you really need is to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Then, as with any Flutter app, you run `flutter packages get` to install dependencies.

The app is built using the [scoped_model](https://pub.dev/packages/scoped_model) package, which is worth knowing about. Other than that, it pretty much works like any basic Flutter app, so there's not much else that needs to be said.

### Generate app icon
I used the flutter_launcher_icons package for that, so follow [these instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons).
