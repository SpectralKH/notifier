# Notifier

A notification scheduling Android app with support for repeating notifications.

## Getting Started

All you really need is to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Just run `flutter run` to start debugging the app, like you would with any Flutter app.

The app is built using the [scoped_model](https://pub.dev/packages/scoped_model) package, which is worth knowing about. Other than that, it pretty much works like any basic Flutter app, so there's not much else that needs to be said.

### Generate app icon

I used the `flutter_launcher_icons` package for that, so follow [these instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons).

### Build

Before releasing a Flutter Android app, make sure to follow [these steps](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android).

Generate Android apk: `flutter build apk`
Generate Android app bundle: `flutter build appbundle`
